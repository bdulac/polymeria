<em>Polymeria</em> is a set of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/">Web components</a> for rendering an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2">Eclipse UML2</a> model file. A <a href="http://bdulac.github.io/note/web-components-adapation-xml-document">post on my personal blog</a> details the initiative. The project started following my <a target="_blank" href="http://bdulac.github.io/note/web-components-polymer">discovery of the Polymer project</a>. In the first place this was only about playing with Polymer on my spare time. The idea seems interesting and the project keeps evolving.

<a target="_blank" href="http://bdulac.github.io/sample/polymeria">An early sample</a> is available and shows the modifications between the initial UML2 model and the web components. If you want to test or have a look at the components code, just clone the repository and check the <em>sample.html</em> file.

Because of custom elements compatibility constraints (dash needed), the model file cannot be rendered without a transformation of UML element names.
