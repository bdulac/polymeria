*Polymeria* UML
========

*Polymeria* UML is a set of [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) [Web components](http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/) rendering an [Eclipse UML2](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2) model file. Because of custom elements compatibility constraints (dash needed), the model file cannot be rendered without a transformation of UML element names. The project started following my [discovery of the Polymer project](http://bdulac.github.io/note/web-components-polymer). A [post on my blog](http://bdulac.github.io/note/web-components-adapation-xml-document) details my early problems.

[An early sample](http://bdulac.github.io/sample/polymeria) is available and shows the modifications between the initial UML2 model and the web components. If you want to play with the components, the [installation with Bower is documented](http://bdulac.github.io/polymeria/installation-bower/) in the GitHub pages.
