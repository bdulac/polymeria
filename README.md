*Polymeria*
========

*Polymeria* is a set of [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) [Web components](http://www.w3.org/TR/custom-elements/) for rendering an [Eclipse UML2](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2) model file. Because of custom elements compatibility constraints (dash needed), the model file cannot be rendered without a transformation of UML element names. The project started following my [discovery of the Polymer project](http://bdulac.github.io/note/web-components-polymer). A [post on my blog](http://bdulac.github.io/note/web-components-adapation-xml-document) details my early problems.

To test, just clone the repository and have a look at the *sample.html* file.
